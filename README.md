# COTI V2 Confidentiality Preserving L2 | SDKs and Examples

All repositories specified below contain smart contracts that implement confidentiality features using the COTI V2 protocol.
The contracts provide examples for various use cases, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), ERC20 tokens, Auction, and Identity management.

These contracts demonstrate how to leverage the confidentiality features of the COTI V2 protocol to enhance privacy and security in decentralized applications.
The contracts are of Solidity and can be compiled and deployed using popular development tools like Hardhat and Foundry (Work in progress).

# COTI v2 Typescript SDK

The COTI Typescript SDK is comprised of two main components:

1. The `crypto.ts` library, which provides cryptographic functions to interact with the COTI network. For a full description of the library visit the [libs readme](src/libs/libs_readme.md).

2. Typescript classes to interact with the COTI network. These are located in the [src/account](src/account) directory. The following are provided:

  * `confidential-account.ts`: designed to handle confidential data by providing methods for encryption and decryption, as well as onboarding new wallets. It utilizes cryptographic functions to ensure the security of data on the COTI network.

  * `onboard_contract.ts`: interact with the onboarding smart contract. The address and ABI allow a web3-enabled application to connect to the contract, listen for events, and call the `OnboardAccount` function to onboard new accounts.

  * `onboard.ts`: facilitates the onboarding of new users by generating cryptographic keys, signing data, and interacting with a blockchain smart contract. The `onboard` function automates the entire process, ensuring secure onboarding and key management.

#### Pending enhancements

- Publishing SDK via npmjs
